# Knowledge Base Kickstart Plan

> _KB = Knowledge Base_

# Quickstart

## Pick a topic

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:dashbird/site.git` (or `git pull` latest changes)
1. Open [`/content/knowledge-base/CONTENT-PLAN.md`](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/CONTENT-PLAN.md) in your IDE/texteditor
1. Pick a topic you're comfortable to write about
1. Write your name in front of it to let others know you're working on that

## Write

1. Make sure to follow the KB [writing style](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/KICKSTART-PLAN.md#writing-style)
1. If you mention concepts that are not in the [KB Glossary](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/GLOSSARY.md), write a quick reference there
1. Below in this doc we [share some tips](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/KICKSTART-PLAN.md#writing-for-the-kb) to write

## Submit for review

1. Once your content piece is ready:
    * Update  appending a `(finished)` to the topic you covered
    * `git commit` and `git push` to our repo
1. Reviewers will analyze
1. Improvements might be suggested and discussed with you before publishing

## Write an article

The KB should increase organic traffic, but it doesn't hurt if we could remix KB content into articles that are publish'able on [DEV.to](https://dev.to), [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com), [Dzone](https://dzone.com), etc.

After finishing your KB content piece, [write an article](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/KICKSTART-PLAN.md#writing-an-article-for-external-publishing) our of it that could be published externally and bring traffic to our site.

# Guidelines

## Who will contribute

Everyone ideally, including our DEV team

Each member of our team can pick a content topic that's comfortable with and start writing

## Review

1. Technical:
    * Taavi
    * Renato
    * DEV team (case-by-case, when needed)
2. Language:
    * Adam (a.k.a. English native speaker)
3. Google-stuff
    * John
4. [KB Glossary](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/GLOSSARY.md) links:
    * John

## Writing style

Your writing should be:
* Formal (_doesn't have to be boring, though_)
* Impersonal: avoid "_cool ways to express_", slang, etc.
* Concise
* Carefully crafted: review at least one, ideally twice, before submitting for review

The [Wikipedia style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) is a good reference.

Check out a few [pages already produced for the KB](https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/) and get a better grasp of what's expected.

One of our main goals is to make it impossible for the reader to tell apart who wrote each content piece. KB pages shouldn't be linked to a particular personal style.

## [Glossary](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/GLOSSARY.md)

Keep an eye on concepts you mention in your KB content. If it's not already covered in the [KB Glossary](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/GLOSSARY.md) and you think it should be, create a short reference for the topic there.

John will wire up the concepts you mention to the appropriate [KB Glossary](https://github.com/dashbird/site/blob/master/content/knowledge-base/GLOSSARY.md) pages after the content is approved for publishing.

# Tips & Tricks

## Writing for the KB

* Research the topic you picked, find good and authoritative sources to educate yourself and fill possible gaps in your knowledge
* It's usually easier to write bullet points at first, then organize those points (order and hierarchy) to structure what you'll cover in the piece
* Start ellaborating on each topic
* Review and connect everything for a coherent whole
* Write an introduction and conclusion that wraps up what your piece covered

## Writing an article for external publishing

* It would be interesting to place links in the article to related KB pages, in order to bring more traffic to our site
* Follow UTM standards when linking to our site
* Since the article will be a standalone piece, it might be interesting to refactor parts of it
    * You could even merge multiple KB pages into one article
    * Or break one KB page into several articles
* Could make sense to explain some concepts in the article, instead of only linking to the Glossary
* A different introduction (and conclusion) might be necessary, since people reading your article not necessarily read other pieces in our KB
