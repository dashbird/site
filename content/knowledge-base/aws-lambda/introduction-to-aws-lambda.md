# What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a Function-as-a-service (FaaS) computing platform provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). As a FaaS, it provides a computing platform to execute code in the cloud. As in any serverless system, it abstracts away the complexities of provisioning and managing a cloud infrastructure.

It is commonly used when building microservices applications, but also serves monolithic and other types of architectures as well. There are several [use cases](https://dashbird.io/blog/best-aws-lambda-serverless-use-cases/) and multiple benefits from using AWS Lambda.


# Lambda execution environment and available runtimes

* Container with a 64-bit Amazon Linux AMI[^1]
* RAM: 128MB to 3008MB, in 64 MB increments
* CPU increases incrementally with RAM[^2]
* Execution duration: up to 900 seconds (or 15 minutes)
* Ephemeral disk space 512MB
* Compressed package size 50MB
* Uncompressed package size 250MB

Lambda supports the following runtimes by default:

* Node.js: v10.15 and v8.10
* Java 8
* Python: 3.7, 3.6, and 2.7
* .NET Core: 1.0.1 and 2.1
* Go 1.x
* Ruby 2.5
* Rust

Developers can implement any other custom runtime of their choosing. The custom runtime will run in the Lambda execution environment. It can be a shell scrit or an executable binary[^3].


# Anatomy of a Lambda function

All Lambda functions consist of three key elements:

* Handler function
  * The main function that will be executed each time an event occurs.
  * Takes two required arguments: an `event` and `context` objects (also takes an optional `callback` object)
* Event Object
  * The first argument to the handler function
  * Contains information about the invocation event
  * An invocation event could be an API request event holding the HTTP request object, for example
* Context object
  * Contains information about the Lambda runtime, such as the function name, version, memory limit, etc.[^4]
  * Provides a method that returns the remaining miliseconds left before the function times out


# AWS Lambda pricing and free tier

Lambda functions are billed by the time it takes to execute your function, being rounded up to the nearest 100ms and the GB-seconds based on the memory consumption. It also comes with a free tier of 1 million requests and 400,00 GB-seconds of compute time each month.

After the free tier, it costs $0.20 per 1 million requests and $0.00001667 for every GB-seconds. The GB-seconds is based on the memory consumption of the Lambda function.
