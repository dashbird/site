##### _**Note**: Overhead is the additional computing power, or excess computation time your system un-necessarily needs to spend to complete a certain task._

#### **Dashbird does <u>not</u> affect the performance of your Lambda Functions.**

Dashbird gets all of the information from logs when they reach AWS CloudWatch, meaning that the service has no effect on the execution itself.
