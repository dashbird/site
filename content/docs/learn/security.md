### How is my data stored in Dashbird?

Dashbird imports logs from your AWS CloudWatch API and stores them in a <u>dedicated</u> and <u>encrypted</u> bucket in S3. After that, logs are aggregated and analyzed into data metrics, which are then stored in a <u>secure database</u> hosted on AWS.

### What if I have a question or a problem?

You can write to us from the app. The tiny chatbox in the bottom-right corner will send us an instant message. If you like email, shoot us a message at <a href='mailto: support@dashbird.io'>support@dashbird.io</a>. We are dedicated to supporting our users and aim to <u>respond in less than an hour</u>.
