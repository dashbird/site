We have <u><b>over-provisioned</b></u> our <a href="/docs/learn/how-it-works/">importer stacks</a> to a point that if half our servers fail for any reason, we could still carry on serving the whole production load for all our clients. Currently our main importing workflow is being hosted on <b>us-east-1</b>, but we also have idle backups ready on <b>us-east-2</b>.
