### What happens when I have to upgrade in the middle of the pricing cycle?

You will be charged for a pro-rated amount proportional to the time left in the billing cycle.

### What happens if I go over my daily ingestion quota?

Dashbird will stop processing your log data for the rest of the day. Log monitoring will resume automatically in the next day.

<br>

### What happens if I go over my monthly ingestion quota?

Dashbird will stop processing your logs for the rest of the month.

### What happens if I go over my Cloud resource count limit?

Your account will be suspended until the number of cloud resources is reduced to a level within the limits of your plan. This only applies to Free plan, since Pro and Enterprise support unlimited Cloud resources.

### Do you offer refunds?

Sorry, no. When you are on a subscription, you can cancel that any time and won't be charged again, but you will still have access to your account until the end of the billing period.

### Do you offer any discounts?

You will get a discount on all plans when you sign up for an annual subscription.
