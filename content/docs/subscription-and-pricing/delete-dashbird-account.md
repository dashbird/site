To remove your Dashbird account you’ll have to go to <a href="https://app.dashbird.io/settings/organization">Account Settings</a> and delete the organisation. The process takes around 30 minutes to complete, once that’s done you can remove the CloudFormation stack from AWS.

If you need help removing your account please send an email to <strong>support@dashbird.io</strong> and one of our colleagues will get this done for you.
