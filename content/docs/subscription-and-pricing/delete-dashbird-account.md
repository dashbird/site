Go to <a href="https://app.dashbird.io/settings/organization">Account Settings</a> and delete the organization. The process takes around 30 minutes to complete. Once it's done, you can remove the CloudFormation stack from your AWS account.

If you need help removing your account please send an email to <strong>support@dashbird.io</strong> and one of our team members will get it sorted.
