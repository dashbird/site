The application dashboard will provide an aggregated view across all your Lambda stack. For a given time period of your interest, it shows (for your entire AWS account and on a per-region basis):

* Total invocations
* Costs incurred in running your Lambdas
* Number of errors identified
* Total and average duration time
* Average memory consumed
* And more...

The dashboard will also contain a summary of the errors and their current state: active (pending for resolution), resolved and muted.
