### How is my data stored in Dashbird?

Dashbird imports logs from your AWS CloudWatch API and stores them in a <u>dedicated</u> and <u>encrypted</u> bucket in S3. After that, logs are aggregated and analyzed into data metrics, which are then stored in a <u>secure database</u> hosted on AWS.



### Access Control

Dashbird logs and provides you with a list of all sessions in your organization account. It is also possible to revoke access from any session, giving an extra layer of control over who has access to your account.
