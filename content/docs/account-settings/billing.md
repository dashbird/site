## Annual vs monthly billing ##

## Prorating ##
Dashbird billing is transparent and fair. If you upgrade your plan in the middle of the billing cycle, you will charged the new plans price at that time for the rest of the month.

## Invoices ##

You will receive automatic invoices to the email that is connected with your account.

## 14-day trial ##

You will automatically start your 14-day trial once you sign up for a new Dashbird account. Each organization has a separate subscription and trial period.

Once your trial has expired, system will attempt to charge you. If no billing info has been entered, your organization account will be suspended.

## Ending subscription ##

You can end your subscription any time from your [Subscription](https://app.dashbird.io/client/subscription/setup/tier) page and you will not be charged again by the next billing cycle.

*NB: there will be no refunds based on the unused time on your account. You will continue to have access to all the features until your last payment credit runs out (either it was monthly or annual payment).*
