The new importer works by streaming logs from CloudWatch with a Kinesis stream ensures that Dashbird does not miss a single invocation and that the delay is not dependant on the inner workings or Dashbird log-polling worker. 

### Improved data integrity and scalability
A major improvement is addressing the developers need for easy observability into their serverless applications. Now the latency has been shaved down to **under 30 seconds**. With the old importer youâ€™d have to wait around 2 minutes to see function updates in the dashboard so getting that number lower was a big win. 

**What this means for you is that you will be able to basically monitor your app in real time.**
