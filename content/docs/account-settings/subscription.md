### 14-day trial

You will automatically start your 14-day trial once you sign up for a new Dashbird account. Each organization has a separate subscription and trial period.

You will have unlimited access to all the Dashbird plans and features during the trial period. After the trial period ends, you are asked to add your credit card information on the [Subscription](https://app.dashbird.io/client/subscription/setup/tier) page in order to subscribe to a specific plan and to keep using Dashbird.
