### Free tier
Our Free Tier offers you one gigabyte(1GB) of data. This is based on the size of the logs we get from your AWS account. You can signup now without ever adding a credit card and you can upgrade at anytime from within the application.

### 14-day trial

You will automatically start your 14-day trial once you sign up for a new Dashbird account. Each organization has a separate subscription and trial period.

You will have unlimited access to all the Dashbird plans and features during the trial period. After the trial period ends, you are asked to add your credit card information on the [Subscription](https://app.dashbird.io/client/subscription/setup/tier) page in order to subscribe to a specific plan and to keep using Dashbird. You can also choose to use the free plan.


### Support for non-profits and startups

We are helping out startups with special discounts. In order to get it, please [write to us](mailto:info@dashbird.io) and answer following questions:

### Ending subscription

You can end your subscription any time from your [Subscription](https://app.dashbird.io/client/subscription/setup/tier) page and you will not be charged again by the next billing cycle.

*NB: there will be no refunds based on the unused time on your account. You will continue to have access to all the features until your last payment credit runs out (either it was monthly or annual payment).*
