Once you've configured your AWS account to connect to Dashbird, get ready to find out the basics about your account settings.

## User settings

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-md-left pt-3">
    <p class="lato">Navigating to the <a href="https://app.dashbird.io/profile">Profile</a> settings is super simple, just choose the <b>Profile</b> option from the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the navigation bar.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 imgs-fluid">
    <img src='/images/docs/profile-menu-dropdown.png'>
  </div>
</div>

After reaching the **User settings** you'll have the freedom to edit your general account settings, change your password if you so wish, and of course tweak your E-mail notification settings.

## Session history
Another incredibly convenient feature is the ability to have an **overview of all user sessions** your account has been accessed with. But, it doesn't stop there, you can also revoke any session you want, giving you another layer of security regarding account access. Now that's just cool.

## Start auto reload
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-md-left pt-3">
    <p class="lato">The final thing to learn about your account's basic setup is the <code>start auto reload</code> button in the top navigation bar.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 imgs-fluid">
    <img src='/images/docs/profile-auto-reload.png'>
  </div>
</div>
By toggling this to `on`, you'll have enabled the auto reload feature for all graphs across your entire account. **No need to hit** `F5`, just **let Dashbird reload everything automagically for you!**
