**There is <u>almost no added cost</u> to your AWS bill.**

AWS prices Data-transfer out of CloudWatch equivalently to Data-transfer from EC2. <br>Check it out for yourself on AWS at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/" target='_blank'>CloudWatch pricing</a>

The first GB of the month is free, with every GB after that $0.09.<br>
The amount added to your bill is insignificant. [Here's](/blog/saving-money-switching-serverless/) an article explaining it in more detail.

<!-- - explain how data transfer works on AWS
- explain the ridiculously tiny price
- emphasis on insignificant add to cost
