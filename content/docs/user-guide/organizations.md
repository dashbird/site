### Onboarding
You can currently **[onboard one AWS account](/docs/get-started/quick-start/), connect it to Dashbird** and access it through the same interface as your personal user account. We call the connected AWS account an **organization**. You can check it out by hovering on the top right dropdown menu.

### Multiple Organizations
We are working hard on creating the ability to merge multiple AWS accounts into one Dashbird account. Stay tuned, it will be up-and-running as soon as possible!

But, if you really want to have it right away **let us know and we'll implement a custom solution for you**. Press the **tiny chat bubble in the bottom right corner** to let us know!

In this case, each **organization**:

- is connected to separate AWS account and only shows data for that account
- is billed separately according to the chosen plan and subscription type
- has different user accounts connected to it
- has different importing and alerting configurations
