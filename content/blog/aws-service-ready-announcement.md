**Dashbird, centralised observability and incident detection platform for serverless applications.**

Team Dashbird is proud to announce that we have achieved the AWS Lambda Ready designation, part of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Service Ready Program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-ready/). This designation recognizes that Dashbird’s serverless monitoring and debugging platform has demonstrated successful integration with AWS Lambda. When customers build with AWS Lambda, they need the right tools to help them easily deploy, monitor, and secure their AWS Lambda-based workloads. The AWS Lambda Ready Program highlights APN (Amazon Partner Network) Partners that deliver developer tooling solutions validated by AWS serverless experts. 

Achieving the AWS Lambda Ready designation differentiates Dashbird as an AWS Partner Network (APN) member with a product integrating with AWS Lambda and is generally available and fully supported for AWS customers. By receiving this certificate, Dashbird is able to demonstrate success in building products integrated with AWS services, helping AWS customers evaluate and use their technology productively, at scale, and varying levels of complexity. The AWS Lambda Ready Program makes it easy for AWS customers to find solutions that follow AWS best practices for integrating with AWS Lambda and have demonstrated value for customers developing serverless applications. 

To receive an AWS Service Ready designation for AWS Lambda, Dashbird went through validation to verify following the AWS best practices for integrating with AWS Lambda and that our product is being used in customers’ production workloads. “Dashbird is delighted to achieve AWS Service Ready status. It’s important for us to be recognized for our team’s hard work of helping companies build and operate complex serverless workloads,” said Taavi Rehemägi, CEO at Dashbird. “We have recently launched an additional range of advanced tools to enable even more detailed insights and guarantee a more proactive and secure approach to app performance on AWS.”

To support the seamless integration and deployment of these solutions, AWS established the [AWS Service Ready Program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-ready/) to help customers identify products integrated with AWS services and spend less time evaluating new tools, and more time scaling their use of products that are integrated with AWS Services. 

Customers value Dashbird’s automated alerting system, comprehensive dashboards and search capabilities, and in-depth debugging data for the whole range of managed cloud services, enabling developers to deliver high-quality experiences for their end-user.

Dashbird helps companies, including [Shamrock](https://dashbird.io/shamrock-case-study/), Meltwater, [Blow Ltd](https://dashbird.io/blow-ltd-case-study/), and Accenture, who operate on AWS serverless Lambda functions, to deliver and operate resilient serverless applications, save time and money by monitoring resource usage, and providing in-depth actionable insights into complex issues for their distributed cloud architectures.  

Dashbird features advanced issue management for teams with its proactive notifications and pre-set automated alerts, resulting in seamless cooperation and allowing even the smallest teams to tackle the potential issues quickly before they impact the application and the end-user.

"Customer success is deeply rooted in our core values. We're excited to keep working with AWS and find ways to help further improve the all-around experience and benefits for AWS users", says Marek Tihkan, CTO at Dashbird.
