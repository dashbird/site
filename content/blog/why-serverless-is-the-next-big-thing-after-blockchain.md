Just like Blockchain profoundly challenged centralized banking and the way we handle financial transactions, serverless is now bringing cloud computing and application development to a whole new level. The benefits of serverless for both small and large businesses have been widely discussed in countless articles across the web, but what about its larger potential to transform organisations? Here’s why we think that serverless is the next big thing.

### Smarter use of resources

One of the key advantages of serverless is its pay-per-use system. Instead of a fixed monthly or annual server fee where the actual use is not taken into account, with serverless you are charged only for the actual amount of resources consumed by an application. You no longer have to pay for what you don’t really need.

In addition, serverless helps you save money and time on server maintenance and continuous manual scaling. Why should you keep on paying to reinvent the wheel when there is a more efficient way – delegating server management to the provider. 

### Serverless lets you focus on what is really important – your users
Thanks to serverless developers don’t have to worry about managing the server or deal with capacity planning, monitoring, scaling and troubleshooting. As a result, more time and resources can be dedicated to much more important things, like improving the user experience of your applications. Users don’t care how much effort you put into maintaining your infrastructures. All that matters to them are the features and whether they are easy and comfortable to use. Focusing on user experience is a considerable shift which can benefit both the business and the users.

### Acceleration of innovation

With server maintenance out of the way, it all comes down to just writing the code to run applications, which leads to much faster releases. This means that instead of weeks and months we are talking about hours and days to release a new application. A faster release time allows businesses to be highly responsive and transform innovative ideas into actual solutions much quicker.

That’s not all. Serverless provides starting businesses with limited funds the possibility to develop services and products without immediately being charged for server capacities they are not using yet. Pay-per-use system gives a green light to getting new projects started even without having a large budget to invest in infrastructure. 

### Faster performance

With serverless technology computing is outsourced to cloud providers with high-performing servers. This results in continuous demand based auto-scaling, which offers fast performance and stability on a level that would otherwise be difficult to achieve.

### Conclusion

Serverless is definitely not suitable for everyone, but for many software developers it can be exactly the kind of thing that makes a real change. Allowing to leave tedious and costly server management aside, it enables businesses to focus on their customers’ needs and create innovative solutions faster and more efficiently.
