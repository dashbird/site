We are very excited to announce that we have officially closed the seed round funding for <a href="https://dashbird.io" target="blank">Dashbird<a/> and can now focus solely on building the best serverless observability tool out there.

## What are we doing with the money?

We aim to <a href="https://dashbird.io/jobs" target="blank"> hire up to 10 new people<a/> in order to widen our product offering and to educate the general public about the benefits of Dashbird and serverless computing in general. **We are planning to build out integrations for event sources and to cover all major cloud providers.**


Our ambition is to be the best serverless monitoring and debugging platform that offers a lot of value to all the companies that are building serverless systems. We also want to push the serverless movement forward because we believe it will be the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/serverless-survey-77-delivery-speed-4-dev-workdays-mo-saved-26-aws-monthly-bill-d99174f70663" target="blank"> next major paradigm shift<a/> in cloud computing.

## What is serverless?
Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.


## What is Dashbird?
Dashbird is a serverless monitoring and debugging platform that helps engineers get a centralized overview of all of their lambda functions and increases the reliability of their applications through error tracking.
