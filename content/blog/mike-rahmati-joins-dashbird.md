    <p>Mike Rahmati has joined as Head of Advisory Board at Dashbird, bringing with him a wealth of firsthand experience and knowledge from the cloud and serverless world. Mike is the Co-Founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.cloudconformity.com/">Cloud Conformity</a> (acquired by Trend Micro), a Cloud Security Posture Management Solution, and is an active <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/mike-rahmati/">AWS Community Hero</a>.</p>

With an already extensive background in security and cloud architecture, it was an easy match to go Serverless at Cloud Conformity. _"As cloud security is a very competitive area, we needed to build fast - from inception to delivery - and get to market quickly"_, Mike says, _"and with AWS, we were able to offload most of the DevOps activities so we could focus on business logic."_ Mike's interest and personal experience in Serverless has only grown since then as Cloud Conformity became one of the earliest and largest adopters of the technology, with now over 3000 Lambda functions in their infrastructure.


Serverless is the new normal and most often isn't the core business of an organization, but it is increasingly necessary for greater focus, faster go-to-market lead times and happier customers.


_"There is a huge market for a product like Dashbird...[at Cloud Conformity] we didn't want to build a tool for Serverless management but were happy to buy one if it solved our problems, and could run side-by-side our own infrastructure without any code changes. Dashbird was and is the only solution that does this."_ - Mike Rahmati


Dashbird works by giving cross-account access to your environment, including AWS CloudWatch, through a new AWS IAM role. The quick setup to the Dashbird platform provides an easy overview of your Serverless infrastructure, including any failures and configuration issues being flagged and detailed for instant investigation and quick remediation.


_"At scale, you need the right tools for Serverless for good, easy management....Dashbird immediately stood out when we were trialling various tools. It wasn't intrusive, didn't need additional code changes and the dashboard summarizes and highlights problems in your architecture giving much needed quick observability,"_ says Mike.

_"Ever since our trial a few years ago, I've been very interested in Dashbird and am so pleased to be able to introduce an ever-evolving tool to my network and community that will solve Serverless-at-Scale issues,"_ he continues. Being onboard as the Head of the Advisory Board and looking to the future, _"I'd love to see Dashbird become an end-to-end monitoring solution for Serverless, and to provide a tool to enable a developer-friendly ecosystem where there is no differentiation between Dev, Ops or Security but all are intertwined seamlessly. We want something similar to the 'Shift Left' idea for the Serverless world. I'm very excited to be a part of that journey with Dashbird."_
