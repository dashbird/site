We are committed to provide the best serverless monitoring and debugging experience out there. Here's what we have been working on lately.

### See real time logs with improved tailing functionality


We have recently rewritten our tailing functionality in [Dashbird](https://dashbird.io), making it more stable and giving you a better understanding what happens.


The new tailing functionality gives you a near real time insights of your running functions, showing you the logs and all other metric needed for the given invocation.



### Trace customer data across all invocations with global search


We can also happily announce that we have revamped our search functionality and it’s already offering a lot of new value to our users with the added [global search.](https://app.dashbird.io/search)


This allows you to quickly and painlessly search for a string, id or whatever else you need throughout the logs of all of your serverless functions!




### Detect cold starts and retries in your lambda invocations


This is a big one! You can now see in your lambda invocations list what invocations have been retried and which ones have been cold-start invocations.
