By now every developer will be able to tell you that serverless is here to stay and you would be missing out if you were not going to start getting in on this action. So to make things easier for you I've compiled of lists of tutorials that will get you going in no time.

So without further ado, here are the top 5 articles that will help you get started with serverless.

<h2>1. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-crash-course-on-serverless-with-node-js-632b37d58b44">A crash course on Serverless with Node.js</a></h2>
In this cleverly constructed, well written tutorial, <a href="https://twitter.com/adnanrahic">Adnan</a> talks about the basics, from setup to deployment. You'll learn just how easy it is to get setup and started with serverless and NodeJs. I would strongly recommend it to anyone just starting out with serverless.

<h2>2. <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/create-your-first-website-in-15-minutes/">Create your first serverless site in 15 minutes </a></h2>
Not to toot my own horn(as it was written by yours truly) but this truly amazing in its simplicity, this next tutorial will show you exactly how easy it is to build a website with serverless, in fact, most of the 15 minutes mentioned in the title will be spent setting up your environment. 

<h2>3. <a href="https://serverless.com/blog/framework-example-golang-lambda-support/">Serverless Framework example for Golang and Lambda</a></h2>
Maciej Winnicki writes an awesome tutorial on how to get a Golang working on a serverless environment. The reason behind this tutorial was simple: Golang support for Lambda has been one of the most anticipated releases. The crowd at re:Invent was ecstatic when Werner announced Golang support was coming soon.


<h2>4. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/serverless-monitoring-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-2b06e7ffd843">Serverless monitoring — the good, the bad and the ugly</a></h2>
One of the first things you will discover while learning serverless is its lack of observability. You don't have the options of checking out an error.log file on your server nor can you run "grep" in a terminal to figure out what is happening behind the scenes. Learning how serverless monitoring works is going to be important!
Adnan points out how, with serverless, it all boils down to the developer mindset. It takes a while to switch from the mental image of a server to FaaS. 

<h2>5. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/fantastic-serverless-security-risks-and-where-to-find-them-737d2206545a">Serverless security risks, and where to find them</a></h2>
Last but not least, the next step in your serverless journey will lead you to question the security risks involved. Since the function as a service paradigm forces you to think differently about your servers will make it hard for the newcomers to understand how to identify and remove the security flaws and risks in their app. Luckily there's an easy to follow tutorial that will help with that.

There you have it, folks, five easy to follow articles that will get you started with serverless in no time. I'd advise you take the time to go over each one of the articles mentioned here and if you got the time jump over to <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/the-complete-serverless-resources-collection/">The complete serverless resources</a> article we published a while back and dive even deeper into serverless.g
