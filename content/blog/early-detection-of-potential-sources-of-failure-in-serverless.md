We recently wrote about [why serverless applications fail and how to design resilient architectures](https://dashbird.io/blog/why-serverless-apps-fail-and-how-to-design-resilient-architectures/). Being able to detect early-stage failure indicators can be invaluable.

With proper monitoring, developers move from waiting for the system to crash and adopt a more proactive attitude in managing resource allocation and architecture design to avoid bottlenecks and performance degradation. This leads to end-user satisfaction, trust among executive team members, and a healthy stream of support requests for customer care agents.

The main challenge is that, even though Serverless abstracts away most traditional infrastructure management, there are still numerous architectural complexities at our hands.

The number and variety of cloud resources we use in serverless applications are growing. Each service has its own intricacies and limitations. Interactions between services increase complexity in rapid proportions. It is difficult to track everything and keep on top of all aspects of such architecture.

Take Queues, for instance. They have to be verified constantly for latency causing high delays, an unusual accumulation of messages in the queue, etc. Compute services, such as AWS Lambda functions or ECS containers have to be monitored for a variety of possible faults, such as high resource (e.g. memory) consumption.

It is also important to have all monitoring metrics, performance and architectural insights in one place so that developers can be efficient to discover and act upon potential issues. Most monitoring platforms, though, still apply a server-based mindset, which doesnâ€™t fit well the serverless paradigm.

Cloud resources cannot be monitored isolated, we must start thinking about our serverless backends as a whole, and almost as living organisms. Otherwise, issues arising from the interaction of services are difficult to track and detect early on.
