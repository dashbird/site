There's no better way to learn about the focal points and enhancements related to serverless than hearing it from the brightest minds in the field. To help you out, we’ve put together our list of the top 9 serverless conferences and events to get you inspired in 2018. 

### 1. <a href='http://paris.serverlessconf.io/' target='_blank'>Serverlessconf</a>
**February 14-15th, Paris**

Serverlessconf is a community led conference focused on sharing experiences about building applications with serverless architectures. According to Serverlessconf, serverless architectures allow developers to express their creativity and to focus on meeting user needs, rather than spending time managing infrastructure and looking after servers.  
Serverlessconf therefore promotes serverless mindset and believes that the future of business lies in leveraging & supporting cloud services. “Do more with less, and focus on delivering creative solutions for your users.”

Why Serverlessconf?
It’s said to be the hottest conference in cloud. 16 glorious talks from the brightest minds in cloud along with 4 lightning talks and 4 unique workshops. You will learn how to develop, deploy and maintain serverless applications from experts doing it today in production. One day of workshops with 8 hours of content. 

### 2. <a href='http://gluecon.com/' target='_blank'>Glue Conference</a>

**May 16-17th, Denver, Colorado**

Glue is a developer­-oriented conference dedicated to Serverless, Containers, Microservices, APIs, DevOps, Mobile, Analytics, Performance Monitoring, Blockchain Applications, cutting edge developer platforms and tools that are changing the technology landscape. 

## Why GlueCon?

“Glue is a case study of what a conference is supposed to be.” It is structured as a two-day conference with significant “after-hours” networking. Unlike many other tech conferences out there, GlueCon is very flexible about the agenda and submission dates. The idea behind it is to respect the dynamic nature of developers and their work. 

### 3. <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/summits/' target='_blank'>AWS Global Summits</a>
