Founded in 2017, Dashbird, is a monitoring and intelligence platform for operating serverless applications on AWS. The platform is designed to give organizations the confidence to build and operate complex serverless applications in modern cloud environments. As companies move from server-centric architectures into distributed, managed cloud applications, they are often running thousands of cloud resources simultaneously. Organizations with a distributed workload in the cloud are faced with having a multiplying number of failure scenarios. DevOps teams are finding the new environment challenging, as complexity issues shift from code to architecture level. 

Dashbird is a one-stop-shop for developers, including an insights engine capable of running complex checks to detect performance, availability, cost and security risks. DevOps teams can stay on top of their applications' performance and ensure a high-quality experience for the end-user, allowing for quick troubleshooting and resolution of errors. This includes typical pain points for developers such as queue delay monitoring, which has been notoriously difficult to keep track of until now.  

Dashbird recently expanded its offering providing in-depth visibility into a wider range of managed cloud services. The new inventory feature allows a complete overview of SQS, API Gateway, ECS (clusters and services) and Dynamo DB. The view enables users to switch between services to gain faster and more detailed insights into their full serverless app performance. See all the new features listed here.

The platform has already been widely adopted in the serverless community, with over 7000 AWS customers relying on it today, and is used by companies at the forefront of cloud development, including Newstore, Shamrock Trading Corporation, and Meltwater. 

Taavi Rehemägi, Dashbird CEO, said, "Building serverless applications has huge benefits for businesses when it comes to speed of innovation, cost efficiency, and scalability. However, the distributed nature of serverless makes it difficult for developers to keep on top of. This is where Dashbird comes in".

Tom Clute, Vice President, Paladin Capital Group, added, "While the business benefits of adopting serverless computing are clear, this fundamental shift has created considerable pain points for developers with traditional application management and security. We're pleased to be funding innovation in this area by backing Dashbird and our investment will enable the continued growth of the team and product development". He will join Dashbird as a board member.

Dashbird is planning to use the investment to expand its product offering to cover the majority of managed cloud services and increase the headcount in their growth and product development teams. In addition to their head office in Tallinn, Estonia, the company has recently opened its second office in London, UK and has recruited Paul Garner as their VP of Sales.
